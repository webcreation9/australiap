<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.</li>

The GDPR states that personal data must be &ldquo;processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures&rdquo;. The GDPR is deliberately vague about what measures organizations should take, because technological and organizational best practices are constantly changing. Currently, organizations should encrypt and/or pseudonymize personal data wherever possible, but they should also consider whatever other options are suitable.</li>
